# Savara 2026 Styling Guide

## Brand Soul: ChronoSync
Savara 2026 is themed **ChronoSync**: the alignment of time, culture, and technology, where individual moments synchronize into something enduring.

- Separate rhythms merge into harmony.
- Isolated instances shape history when connected.
- Past influences the present, and the present engineers the future.
- Tradition and progress must coexist in one visual language.
- The core feeling is convergence, collaboration, precision, and shared momentum.

Every design choice should feel like timelines meeting: ceremonial + futuristic, warm + cosmic, human + engineered.

## Core Visual Direction
- Mood: ancient ritual fused with advanced systems.
- Contrast: glowing warmth over deep dark surfaces.
- Texture: subtle grain/stone/pattern overlays, never flat backgrounds.
- Composition: layered depth (background image/video, overlays, atmospheric gradients, foreground type).
- Rhythm: smooth motion and progressive reveals tied to scroll/time.

## Color System
Primary gradient anchors:
- `#d11d1d` (deep ritual red)
- `#f09431` (ember orange)
- `#4a106f` (chrono violet)

Recommended neutrals (already aligned with current site):
- Background base: `#0a0408`
- Surface dark: `#2a1f1a`
- Text primary: `#f5e6d3`
- Accent metallic: `#d4a574`

Usage rules:
- Prefer multi-stop gradients over flat fills.
- Use warm-to-violet gradient for headings, highlights, key dividers, and CTA borders.
- Keep body text high contrast and readable (`#f5e6d3` / reduced-opacity variants).
- Reserve strong saturation for focal points; keep large surfaces subdued.

## Typography
- Headings/ceremonial moments: **Cinzel** (uppercase, tight tracking for impact).
- Body/interface text: **Rajdhani** (clean, techno-architectural readability).
- Tone: premium, epic, precise; avoid playful or casual visual language.

Type behavior:
- Large hero titles should feel monumental but controlled.
- Supporting text should stay airy with generous line height.
- Use gradient text on key words sparingly to preserve emphasis.

## Layout and Components
- Hero section should dominate first impression with layered atmospheric depth.
- Navigation should feel minimal but cinematic (glow, blur, subtle motion).
- Section transitions should blend using top/bottom gradient fades.
- Cards/grids should use translucent dark surfaces with soft borders and hover light.
- Footer should remain structured, readable, and visually grounded.

## Motion Language
- Motion should reflect synchronized timelines: smooth, deliberate, never jittery.
- Preferred patterns:
  - Staggered reveal on section entry
  - Slow parallax/ambient drift in backgrounds
  - Soft pulse glows for atmospheric elements
  - Gentle hover scaling with gradient shimmer
- Keep animation meaningful and restrained; avoid noisy micro-interactions.

## Media and Performance Constraints
- Preserve cinematic visuals but optimize aggressively:
  - Use responsive `next/image` for hero/background art.
  - Defer heavy video until near viewport.
  - Keep above-the-fold assets lightweight and prioritized.
- Visual richness must not compromise initial load quality.

## Interaction Principles
- Emphasize continuity and flow between sections.
- Hover/focus states should feel luminous, not abrupt.
- CTA styling should signal prestige and momentum (gradient edge, subtle glow).
- Accessibility remains mandatory: readable contrast, semantic structure, keyboard focus.

## Do / Avoid
Do:
- Blend ritual aesthetics with modern technical precision.
- Keep gradients, overlays, and depth consistent across sections.
- Make each section feel like a chapter in one timeline.

Avoid:
- Flat, plain white layouts or generic startup UI styling.
- Random color additions outside the core palette.
- Overcrowded motion or inconsistent animation timing.
- Visual decisions that break the ChronoSync narrative.
